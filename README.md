# botmeister
==================
## Not Just Another WordPress plugin.

#### This one is a gamechanger, folks!<br></br>
Botmeister is an exclusive anti-spam WordPress solution that employs a next-generation technology called TypingDNA. 

Developed by a crack team of Romanian software engineers, the TypingDNA algorithm can fingerprint the keystrokes as text is being added to a comment or login box and identify that same individual with nearly 100% accuracy from a single interaction. 

To add fuel to the fire, TypingDNA created an API that provides nearly a dozen features with crucial data metrics that power the plugin's automated ability to react to shut down bots and human spammers in real-time. 

### NOTE: To install in a development environment, you must run `composer install` in the root directory after cloning this repo. Otherwise you will not have the required dependencies in your project.
